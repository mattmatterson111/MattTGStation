  - rscadd: "A shrink ray for abductors that they can buy at their console for 2 experiment points. Anything can be shrunken, and shrunken things can be walked over/seen past (for example, you can shrink a wall and then walk around it). If a human is shrunk, they will drop all of their belongings, move slower, and take 2x damage."
  - imageadd: "Shrink ray sprites by Fury McFlurry. Thank you!"
